## Data Analysis Slidedeck Report and Zoom Presentation

I created the following technical report slidedeck and zoom presentation as part of a 'Communicating Data Results' class in my Masters in Applied Data Science at the University of Michigan. We were tasked with finding and presenting data to evaluate the prospects of two different counties for a fictional chicken sandwhich franchise based on a series of success indicators provided to us for the assignment:

  - Household income above the national median
  - Younger population  with room for continued growth
  - Strong dining out culture 
  - Conservative culture
  - Car culture (as opposed to reliance on public transportation)
  - Location near a highway and other upscale fast food 

The technical report slidedeck can be found at:

I also created a Zoom presentation of my findings to accompany the technical report (the YouTube video of the Zoom presentatinon below takes a minute to load onto the webpage):
