Check out my [Streamlit app](https://sac-campaign-finance-bnxtfmrjdaslx5nyst3fzn.streamlit.app/) for analyzing Sacramento's campaign finance data. The app aggregates public campaign finance disclosures and allows users to sift through and analyze the data with a high degree of granularity to gain insights into who is financing our local elected officials political campaigns. For example, the screenshots below show how you can visualize the most expensive campaigns and then investigate who their top financiers were. The line graph below shows how Mayor Darrell Steinberg has raked in more cash than any other elected official since 2014, and sorting by date reveals that interestingly $1.4 million out of his $3.2 million total came on a single day: March 22, 2016, with the Barkett family from La Jolla, California as his single biggest contributor when sorting by "Last Name."
