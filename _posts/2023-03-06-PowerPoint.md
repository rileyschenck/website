I created [the following technical report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tCCRJayq7Fh68Ai2HBMp3eYst5PdHtgFPhKDFkl8o08/edit?usp=sharing) slidedeck and an accompanying PowerPoint presentation on Zoom as part of a 'Communicating Data Results' class from my Master of Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan. We were tasked with finding and presenting data to evaluate the prospects of two different counties for a fictional chicken sandwhich franchise based on a series of success indicators provided to us for the assignment:

  - Household income above the national median
  - Younger population  with room for continued growth
  - Strong dining out culture 
  - Conservative culture
  - Car culture (as opposed to reliance on public transportation)
  - Location near a highway and other upscale fast food 

### Technical Report Slidedeck

The report slidedeck (what the screenshot above is from) can be found at [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tCCRJayq7Fh68Ai2HBMp3eYst5PdHtgFPhKDFkl8o08/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tCCRJayq7Fh68Ai2HBMp3eYst5PdHtgFPhKDFkl8o08/edit?usp=sharing).
